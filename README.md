Used Car Quality Detection:
One of the biggest challenges of an auto dealership purchasing a used car at an auto auction is the risk of that the vehicle might have serious issues that prevent it from being sold to customers. The auto community calls these unfortunate purchases "kicks".The challenge of this project is to predict if the car purchased at the Auction is a Kick (bad buy).
